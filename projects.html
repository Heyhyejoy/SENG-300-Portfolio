       <br>
      By working on assignment 1, I felt that I grew a bit as a software engineer. Thing that worked well while working on assignment 1 was planning and making the use case diagram though it was my first time actually creating the use case diagram. I watched lecture videos and powerpoint slides several times for a reference Also, ‚Å§collaborating with initially unfamiliar teammates went smoothly as we efficiently divided tasks and contributed collectively. I believe collaborating with teammates is an important aspect of being a software engineer, as the job requires communication among workers/team members. Initially, I faced the challenge of selecting team members as I did not know anyone in this class. However, I successfully navigated this situation and managed to assemble a cohesive group. I was able to improve my analyzing skills to find out what the customer wants from the description of the system, and skills to create the diagram based on the diagram. For my next assignment, I would like to improve more skills I need to be a software developer, and my leading skills as well.
      <br>
      Assignments 2 and 3 were much more challenging than assignment 1. Since it was a difficult assignment, I had to watch lesson videos and read slides several times, but it was nice that I was able to gain new skills of creating charts and testing the codes. Working with the same teammates made the assignment flow easily. Teammates I met in assignment 1 all worked well on parts that they were assigned. We communicated and cooperated when working on the assignments. Everyone was satisfied by each other's work, which made us work on all three assignments together. Gaining skills and cooperating with teammates made me feel I am slowly improving. Although it is also going to be challenging, for the upcoming project iteration I would like to improve more skills with new teammates.
